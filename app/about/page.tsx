                <h2 className="mt-8">Hi there! I'm Bianca.</h2>
                <p>For the past ~5 years, I’ve been working as a design generalist for startups, investors, studios, and communities across fields like AI, Web3, and edtech. Sketching screens, crafting graphics, writing code...you name it, I’ve probably done it. I thrive best in the 0 → 1 stage, where I <strong>help turn ambiguous visions into concrete artifacts</strong> — especially when I get to build them out myself.</p>
                <p>On the side, I write and research about <strong>how technology can bring power to and away from people.</strong> In the past, I’ve written several essays about tech’s intersections with education and labor. Now, I’m exploring how design-centric futures thinking approaches can expand people’s creativity and agency.</p>
                <p>I also love volunteering for local tech communities as an educator and organizer, <strong>helping Filipinos navigate their journeys in tech</strong> — whether it's through teaching design software or facilitating critical discourse. I wouldn’t be where I am today without the generosity of the communities around me, so I aim to do the same and continue the cycle of sharing knowledge.</p>
                <p>When I’m not staring at a screen, I find joy in my <strong>movement practice.</strong> You can find me <a href="https://instagram.com/movesbyb">dancing</a> (e.g. breaking, hiphop, contemporary), learning gymnastics, doing calisthenics, or lifting weights.</p>
