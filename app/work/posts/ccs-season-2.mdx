##### Introduction
## Insert one-liner here

[Crypto, Culture, & Society](https://x.com/CryptoSocietyS1) (CCS) is a learning DAO building the liberal arts for crypto.

CCS started out as a [crowdfunded discussion group](https://g.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x819b12E7b398021fbD9D2acdC8B7349E3D732B51) exploring the impact of crypto on culture and society, which turned out to be a huge success. They wanted to continue this for Semester 2 by opening a new discussion group to the wider public.

##### Season 2 Materials

### Posters

When I was designing the branding for Semester 2, I went for a **composition notebook aesthetic** to encourage people in the Web3 space to want to go “back to school” again.

This warm and tactile aesthetic helped differentiate CCS from the design meta in the Web3 space back then (e.g. dark mode, vibrant gradients, mostly sans serif text).

### NFT Collectibles

The Semester 2 team also decided to give free NFT collectibles to both the students and speakers so that they'd have souvenirs to commomerate their experience.

The NFT for Semester 2 students collates **all the themes from the workshops.**

Meanwhile, the NFT for the Semester 2 speakers is **designed like a book**, specifically tailored to each speaker and their workshop topic.
