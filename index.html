            <h1>Hi! I&#x27;m Bianca Aguilar. I&#x27;m a Manila-based designer-researcher dedicated to cultivating potential in products & people. 🌱</h1>
            <p>My overarching mission is <strong>human flourishing:</strong> how can we all live good, fulfilling, and purposeful lives, and how can we ensure this at both the individual and community levels? This main goal of mine can be seen in everything I do, whether it&#x27;s training as a dancer or being a generalist in tech. </p>
            <p>I&#x27;ve worn all kinds of hats (e.g. technologist, community builder, artist, and more...), but I see these all coming together in my role as a <strong>gardener.</strong> I plant seeds and tend to them so that they can grow — eventually to the point that they can be harvested for everyone&#x27;s benefit. Here&#x27;s how I do it:</p>
            <p>For almost half a decade, I've worked as a generalist designer for tech startups, venture studios, etc. 🚀 across fields like edtech, Web3, and AI. I've also nurtured local tech communities as an educator 👩🏽‍🏫 and community builder 🤝🏽, helping Filipinos navigate their journeys in tech — whether it's through teaching design software or facilitating critical discourse.</p>
            <p>As a writer and researcher, I'm always thinking about <strong>how technology can bring power to and away from the people</strong>, having written several essays exploring tech's intersections with education 📚 and labor. 🧱  I'm also curious about how design-centric futures thinking approaches (e.g. speculative design, design fiction, etc.) 🔮 can expand people's creativity and agency.</p>
            <p>When I'm not staring at a screen, I find joy in my <strong>movement practice.</strong> You can probably find me breaking (a.k.a. breakdancing) 🤸🏽‍♀️ or doing calisthenics. 💪🏼</p>
            <p></p>

                  <h2>How can we foster Filipinos&#x27; critical consciousness of technology?</h2>
                  <p>Ways of using and designing technologies often reinforce inequalities, disproportionately affecting those in the Global South — particularly Filipinos. Being deeply embedded in technology, they bear the brunt of how major social media platforms like Facebook are run. For instance, Filipinos have served as guinea pigs for Big Tech companies and politicians, given that <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/trolls-disinformation-make-philippine-election-coverage-a-challenge/6519577.html">The Philippines has been the primary testing grounds for misinformation campaigns</a>. Furthermore, many Filipinos work as content moderators for these platforms, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/facebook-international-content-moderators/">struggling to filter traumatic content with little support.</a> <br>In general, it is clear that the tech industry is fueled by the exploitation of Filipinos. If the dominant systems, values, norms, and practices (a.k.a. the imaginary) surrounding technology are not problematized, then the future will continue to be inequitable.</p>
                  <p>To question these present realities, I want to use the power of unreality/fiction to stimulate the imagination. Guided by the framework of <a href="https://designjustice.mitpress.mit.edu/">design justice</a>, I set out to accomplish the following objectives:<br></p>
                  <ol start="" role="list">
                    <li>Investigate Filipino&#x27;s future technological imaginaries (a.k.a. the implicit beliefs Filipinos have about the role of technology in their future lives) and see how these shape their lives</li>
                    <li>Make these imaginaries tangible and visible in an educational, engaging, and accessible website</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>For this initial iteration, I decided to make my target audience Filipino <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/knowledge-workers/">knowledge workers</a>. While I knew that an informative website was not capable of engaging the entire Filipino population, I also believed that tech workers weren&#x27;t the only ones who could benefit from this.  Knowledge workers are not only literate enough to access the website, but they are also undeniably afflicted by technological imaginaries, given how their roles are enabled by technology. Moreover, I believe that they have an active role to play in shaping the future for all Filipinos, whether or not they&#x27;re working in the tech industry. Thus, gaining more critical awareness would be crucial for them.</p>

                  <h2>Collating research-based design fictions</h2>
                  <p>E-MAHINASYON is a virtual exhibition of Filipinos&#x27; technological futures. Intertwining research findings and design fiction, it explores various future scenarios in order to illustrate Filipinos&#x27; relationship with technology. Overall, it seeks to inform and provoke Filipinos about the social, cultural, and ethical implications of emerging technologies in the Philippines.</p>
                  <p>The website features three scenarios: <strong>optimistic, pessimistic, and probable.</strong> Each scenario is described through themes and subthemes, which are then further visualized through galleries of insights. Each insight comes with the following:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>A <strong>short description</strong> that provides a bird&#x27;s eye view of what this insight would look like in a future Philippines</li>
                    <li>A <strong>carousel of examples</strong> (mini-stories with blurbs and images) that make this insight feel more palpable</li>
                    <li>A list of <strong>selected quotes</strong> from interviewees that contributed to the development of this insight</li>

                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>To accomplish my first objective (investigating imaginaries), I needed to do in-depth <strong>research and sensemaking.</strong> Wanting to gather a diverse range of voices and perspectives, I decided to embark on parallel research approaches:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Ethnographic research:</strong> This approach aims to learn about Filipinos&#x27; beliefs, values, and understandings about the future and technology. The people interviewed under this approach were professionals who have at least 1 year of experience working in the tech industry. Their interview&#x27;s structure was based on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001632879500011K" target="_blank">The Ethnographic Futures Research method</a>, wherein they described their projected images of the future — or in other words, the potential changes they want, fear, and expect in their sociotechnical system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foresight research:</strong> This approach aims to to evaluate the impact of emerging technologies on Filipinos. The people interviewed under this approach were professionals from various fields (e.g. industry, academia, the arts) who were deemed to have expertise in understanding emerging technologies, along with their social and ethical implications. Their interview discussion guide was based on methods from the <a href="https://cdss.berkeley.edu/hce-toolkit" target="_blank">Berkeley College of Computing, Data Science, and Society&#x27;s Human Context &amp; Ethics Toolkit</a>, which help analyze phenomena (i.e. technologies, institutions, problems) in the datafied world. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The personal visions gathered from the ethnographic research served as a micro perspective; they were then further enriched when situated in the general technological landscape described in the foresight research, which provided the macro perspective. Once I was done with all the interviews, they underwent reflexive thematic analysis: a combination of both inductive and deductive approaches to coding. I also conducted desk research to find supporting resources for the interviews&#x27; insights. Then, I wrote out my research findings as 4 chapters of my thesis, which then served as the website&#x27;s content.</p>
                  <p>Next, I worked towards my second objective (materializing imaginaries) by <strong>designing and developing the virtual exhibition.</strong> Speculative and critical design were utilized to visualize the future scenarios, while UX design was used in creating the container for these scenarios. After this, I used Webflow to bring these designs to life. The design and development of the website was a circular process, with me often cycling between stages. Finally, once I had an MVP of the website, I conducted user testing with a small sample of people.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>Summary of Research Findings</h2>
                  <p>Based on the interviews, Filipinos expect to see ubiquitous computing in a future Philippines, whether it is optimistic and pessimistic. What differentiates the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios is their motivation for development; the former is centered around the people, while the latter is centered around profit. And while the probable scenario contains elements from both scenarios, it leans more towards the pessimistic, reflecting a prevailing sense of cynicism amongst Filipinos.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>

                  <p>Additionally, the interviews also showed that Filipinos...</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>🌐 Have a paradoxical relationship with technology:</strong> Despite being terminally online, many Filipinos seem to lack technological literacy.</li>
                    <li>‍<strong>👊 Are steadfast in our beliefs:</strong> This makes us uphold our values and traditions, but we are also resistant to change.</li>
                    <li>‍<strong>🕸️ Are made by systems of oppression:</strong> Colonialism, capitalism, and classism continue to hold us back as a people.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>Exhibition Creation Process</h2>
                  <h3>Information architecture</h3>
                  <p>To start translating the research insights into a website-ready format, I began by constructing a sitemap. At the same time, I drafted sketches of the website to help with envisioning specific page structures, given that I&#x27;m a visual thinker. This process helped me come up with the general structure of a scenario page: <strong>Scenario → Theme → Subtheme → Insight.</strong></p>
                  <p>‍</p>

                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>This process also helped inform the design of the website’s content management system. Thanks to knowing how I wanted to structure and visualize the research findings, I was able to determine how to group these into collections of content, along with the relation of these collections to each other. To envision these collections and their relationships, I created a simple entity relationship diagram (ERD). Thanks to this ERD, I was able to have an easier time developing the website in Webflow.</p>

                  <h3>Interface design +AI ART GENERATION</h3>
                  <p>Now that I had an idea of how to structure information on my website, I was able to start making low-fidelity wireframes. Once I was happy with the basic form, I then proceeded to designing high-fidelity mockups, which were more polished and accurate simulations of the website. To guide my designs, I created a simple style guide consisting of a color palette and typography. With this, I was able to design consistently styled components for the website faster.</p>

                  <p>I used AI art generators (i.e. DALL-E 3 and Pika) to create the visuals in my website because of the following reasons. One reason is personal constraints; since I was doing all the research, design, and development by myself, I needed help to ensure that I could finish my thesis on time. Another reason is the aesthetic; I thought that the quirks of AI art suited the topic of my thesis.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h3>Website development</h3>
                  <p>I chose to use Webflow because it is not only a no-code website builder, but also an integrated content management system. Once I created my 6 collections: Themes, Categories, Insights, Examples, Quotes, and Interviewees, I was able to connect them to existing design elements on my site, which Webflow would then automatically fill up for me. For instance, after building a list of Insight cards, once I connected the Insight collection to it, Webflow automatically populated it with data from my collection. Furthermore, Webflow automatically creates template pages for each collection too; once I designed the page template for Insights, I was already able to see populated data there.</p>

                  <h2>User Testing Results</h2>
                  <p>I gathered feedback from my respondents through both quantitative (<a href="https://www.ueq-online.org/" target="_blank">User Experience Questionnaire</a>) and qualitative approaches.</p>
                  <p>What respondents liked about the website was that...</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>🤓 It had high-quality &amp; trustworthy content:</strong> The website&#x27;s content was deemed not only insightful (thanks to the research), but also interesting to read (thanks to the stories).</li>
                    <li><strong>👌 It&#x27;s intuitive to use:</strong> They found it easy to navigate through the website and find needed information.</li>
                    <li><strong>🥽 It&#x27;s an immersive experience:</strong> One respondent described the website as a giant thesis story; others said that the scenarios truly felt realistic (thanks to the visuals)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>However, they thought that the website could be further improved because...</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>🧻 It&#x27;s still lacking in visual aesthetics:</strong> The lack of readability made respondents feel overwhelming with the amount of information. Additionally, some respondents also believed that certain parts of the design (e.g. palette, layout) were unsuitable for such information.</li>
                    <li><strong>❓ It had insufficient content:</strong> Respondents wished to see more stories (because I couldn&#x27;t add to every insight) and contextual information (i.e. how can we avoid or reach these scenarios?)</li>
                    <li><strong>🤖 It utilized AI-generated art:</strong> While some respondents loved the AI-generated visuals, others hated it due to the disconnecting feeling they conveyed, along with being ethically controversial.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>Working on this project for almost two years has left me with several reflections:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>Taking on this problem felt like learning how to <strong>spotlighting the elephant in the room.</strong> Having worked in tech for years, I was frustrated by the lack of discourse surrounding such a wicked problem (tech&#x27;s exploitation of Filipinos). This was what drove me to put so much effort into this project, even if it was costly.</li>
                    <li>In the end, <strong>everything is just information.</strong> This is what allowed me to convey abstract concepts (i.e. imaginaries) through concrete forms. The tracks I major in (Information Design and Computer Science) deal with information in different ways, and writing turned out to be at the core of these disciplines. Information served as the foundation of the website; if it was not organized well, how could I even design and develop it?</li>
                    <li><strong>Human intelligence</strong> would still be vital, even in an age dominated by AI. Despite all the information that can be stored in its memory, there’s still so much that cannot be captured by AI; facts about the Philippines cannot compare to the experience of living as a Filipino. Thus, meaningful innovation would still require a human touch.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                  <p>While I only got to accomplish a fraction of my original vision, I am excited for all the ways this project could evolve in the future. Here are some recommendations:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>📚 Add more speculative narratives:</strong> The user testing showed how fictional stories were really successful in conveying the social and ethical implications of emerging technologies on the Philippines. Creating more would definitely make the project more resonant for Filipinos.</li>
                    <li><strong>🎦 Explore more accessible formats:</strong> Due to limited connectivity and literacy, much of the Internet remains inaccessible to many Filipinos, leaving them stuck in large platforms like Facebook, Tiktok, and Youtube. Social media posts and short films would definitely be able to reach a larger audience.</li>
                    <li><strong>🤝 Make the project collaborative:</strong> All of these ideas for improvement would be impossible to pursue alone, given how much I struggled to make this initial MVP. With the help of others, this project would have the power to make a dent on the world.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>After taking a break to recharge, I plan to further develop E-MAHINASYON by 1.) expanding to popular social media platforms and 2.) crowdsourcing design fictions. These developments would not only improve the project’s reach, but also its engagement with the Filipino people. If you have any ideas, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out! :)</p>

                  <h2>Curation in crypto isn&#x27;t being done effectively.</h2>
                  <p>There is a plethora of great content online (i.e. articles, videos, podcasts, tweets) that attempts to explain crypto/web3 concepts. However, curation around this content is almost always superficial — usually an aggregation of links on a page or people to follow in a Twitter thread. Most attempts at curation don&#x27;t consider a reader&#x27;s prior exposure to a topic, include no key takeaways or excerpts that provide a preview of the content, and have no knowledge mapping between different pieces of content.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>It&#x27;s time to show what effective curation looks like.</h2>
                  <p>The Lexicon is a curated Web3 learning resource for individuals of all proficiency levels. Initiated by the <a href="http://ccsdao.xyz">Crypto, Culture, &amp; Society DAO</a>, it aims to raise the standard of curation in the space as a public good that&#x27;s evergreen and open-sourced for new contributions.</p>
                  <p>We wanted to make this resource useful for the following personas:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Brand New:</strong> people who have never consumed anything related to crypto, but may be aware of the space through news headlines or through friends. They might lean towards skepticism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Explorer:</strong> People who have some exposure from consuming educational content, participating in the space by joining a DAO and/or investing in a crypto asset. They’re eager to learn more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Builder:</strong> People who are core contributors on crypto projects and/or create new content about the space. They want tactical, specific advice or nuanced deep dives.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>For our MVP, we decided to focus on a single persona and topic: <strong>DAOs for beginners.</strong></p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>Creation starts from coordination.</h2>
                  <p>We started off with workshops. First, I facilitated a persona workshop that would help us further profile our target audiences. This was guided by the following questions:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>How are they learning now? </li>
                    <li>What&#x27;s most challenging about this (the process of learning)? </li>
                    <li>How do they learn best?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The descriptors we gathered helped me visualize how The Lexicon&#x27;s design would be personalized for each of our personas.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/personas_1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Then, we decided to create a mindmap of DAOs. This would allow us to understand and define our scope (i.e. how much are we going to cover?). Members were encouraged to make their own mindmaps first before adding to the master mindmap; this way, people wouldn&#x27;t be afraid to start contributing.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/mindmap.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Soon after, many more contributors started to get involved with this project. We were split into the following teams:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>‍<strong>Design: </strong>responsible for overseeing the Lexicon&#x27;s brand, product, and content design (I&#x27;m here!)</li>
                    <li>‍<strong>Instructional design:</strong> responsible for creating the Lexicon&#x27;s overall curation framework (i.e. criteria for assessing the quality of a resource, the information that makes up a content preview, rules for writing a good summary, guidelines for shortlisting featured DAOs)</li>
                    <li>‍<strong>Content curation:</strong> responsible for aggregating high-quality links and resources on  DAOs based on our curation framework</li>
                    <li>‍<strong>Development:</strong> responsible for building the whole Lexicon, both front-end and back-end</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>So much thought was put into how we&#x27;d present ourselves.</h2>
                  <p>I worked with a lovely brand strategist (shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/oddstout">oddstout.eth</a>!)  to figure out the identity of The Lexicon. </p>
                  <p>I started by collecting inspirations for the project&#x27;s look and feel. He then put these all into an organized spectrum, which helped me be more intentional with my design approach.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/spectrum.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>He also came up with an insightful creative brief. This started with diving deep into people&#x27;s increased interest in Web3. An immense structural and psychological shift factored in this (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation">The Great Resignation</a>); beneath this shift is the desire to be equal with everyone else.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/strategy1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>To best respond to this desire, The Lexicon would take the form of a digital garden. I see digital gardens not just as <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">personal, free-form, &amp; work-in-progress wikis</a>, but also as <a href="https://twitter.com/annikaizora/status/1346485669179387912?s=20">pluralistic &amp; interdependent ecosystems.</a> The Lexicon isn&#x27;t the product of someone who collected links and then called it a day; instead, it was intended to be a collaborative project that was continuously tended to. Learning complex topics on your own like Web3 can be difficult, but coming across collaborative curation efforts helps with this burden.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>

                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Overall, the Lexicon&#x27;s branding was grounded on the following core values: </p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> speaks to our insight about participating on an equal footing with everybody else.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transformation:</strong> speaks to our strategic premise of this constant cycle of growth, decay and renewal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community:</strong> speaks to our insight about learning and feeling alone in the journey and dropping off.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>I led the end-to-end design, from UX to UI.</h2>
                  <p>Since we were starting out with beginners, I wanted to design the Lexicon&#x27;s MVP as a guided learning experience. I took inspiration from various knowledge hubs across Web2 and Web3.</p>

                  <p>As soon as they opened the website, I wanted people to already feel like they were being welcomed into a digital garden. This was done through cozy visuals and delightful copy (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/sndy_snchz">Sandy</a>!)</p>

                  <h3>Chapters OVERVIEW</h3>
                  <p>Building on the library theme, I decided to present each chapter as its very own book. The chapters&#x27; visuals were inspired by retro book covers, such as Penguin and Pelican classics.</p>

                  <h3>Chapter DESIGN</h3>
                  <p>I wanted the chapter experience to feel like reading a page of an actual book; I tried to embody this in its design, as seen in the paper background and the delicate typography. Helpful narration would be interwoven with each chapter&#x27;s curated resources, which were then organized by subtopic. Clicking on a resource card would provides a detailed summary of its content. If someone liked what they read, they were free to go to the full resource or share insights on their Twitter.</p>

                  <h3>LEAVE YOUR SIGNATURE</h3>
                  <p>At the end of the whole experience, people can sign a library card. This was inspired by projects like <a href="https://www.interdependence.online/declaration">A Declaration of the Interdependence of Cyberspace</a> and <a href="https://www.web3legacy.xyz/">Legacy.xyz</a>, which both showed how digital signatures could be done through crypto wallets. By connecting a wallet + posting a verification tweet, one can create a signature that truly belongs to them. This process also worked as a form of marketing; seeing verification tweets on their timelines made others curious about these projects. We hoped to do the same for the Lexicon.</p>

                  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                  <p>After building out the other personas, we wanted to open source the Lexicon process to maintain quality, dive deeper, and scale to any topic, including ones outside of crypto. We also wanted to add a social layer, so that people who are interested in meeting with others learning the same topic can form study groups or learn directly from educators. To build this out, we could partner with value-aligned organizations (e.g. Gitcoin/Kernel).</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, the development of the MVP has stalled due to several factors -- namely the impact of the bear market and contributors dropping off due to lack of capacity. Thankfully, Crypto, Culture, &amp; Society still hopes to push this out by later this year or early next year. If you&#x27;re a developer who&#x27;s interested in helping out, please contact me!</p>

                  <p>When I started pursuing design, I found myself lost in a space of confusing ambiguity and information overload. I was only able to get to where I am today thanks to my peers and mentors. Now, I want to do the same for aspiring designers. This motivated me to start sharing my knowledge as a student. It&#x27;s intimidating to begin practicing a craft when people around you are years ahead in experience; I want to be an accessible and approachable guide for others.</p>
                  <p>Ever since the pandemic started, I&#x27;ve dived in teaching online. Here are some talks I&#x27;ve given:</p>

                  <h2>As a design educator, I believe in being...</h2>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Engaging:</strong> Learning doesn&#x27;t happen at a distance; I believe in learning through doing. I always try to integrate hands-on activities and examples of practical application in my classes so that students can fully understand what is being taught. ⛏️</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> I learn from my students just as much as they do from me. I&#x27;m always asking questions (e.g. &quot;What makes up an ideal discussion?&quot;) and requesting for feedback so that I can continue improving as a teacher. I also love using collaborative platforms like Figma that enable me and my students to work together in real-time. 🤝</li>
                    <li><strong>Intentional:</strong> In design, thinking is just as important as making. I explore topics adjacent to design like development and ethics so that my students are able to defend their design decisions. 🧠</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>My approach to teaching: designing learning experiences.</h2>
                  <p>As User Experience Society&#x27;s AVP for Design Training, I was responsible for holding events that would kickstart the members&#x27; design journeys. In the past, workshops conducted by the organization were sporadic and inconsistent. Now that I was in charge, I wanted to ensure that they were more intentional. Thus, I decided to create <strong>Introductory Workshops,</strong> which aimed to turn an aspiring rookie into a seasoned designer. This series consisted of four classes, each subsequent one progressing in difficulty.</p>
                  <ol start="1" role="list">
                    <li>UX/UI Foundations 🐣</li>
                    <li>Figma for Dummies 🛠️</li>
                    <li>Prototyping &amp; Interactions 👟</li>
                    <li>Designing for Development 🏗️</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h3>UX/UI FOUNDATIONS</h3>
                  <p>In this workshop, I introduced the elements and principles of design. These were shown through examples of interfaces so that students could understand their application to product design. To build on this, I had an application section where I compared two interfaces and asked which one was the better one. This was inspired by the Can&#x27;t Unsee game and UI-centric accounts like @ui.sia.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>

                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>At the end, I made the students do a website study. They had to paste a screenshot of their favorite website, then analyze how the elements &amp; principles of design were applied.</p>

                  <p>If there was one thing I could&#x27;ve done better, it would&#x27;ve been the <strong>onboarding for the activity.</strong> Initially, the students didn&#x27;t know what to do. Many of them were new to Figma so they didn&#x27;t know how to navigate the interface. I had to do a quick demonstration in order to get the ball rolling. If I had the chance to redo this workshop, I would&#x27;ve prepared simple instructions for using Figma along with how to do a website study. That way, there wouldn&#x27;t be as much confusion.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h3>Figma for Dummies</h3>
                  <p>In this workshop, I taught the basics of Figma: how to navigate its interface, use its built-in tools, and make components.</p>
                  <p>Here, I took an unconventional approach: I invited the students to simultaneously try out what they were learning while I was presenting in the Figma file. This was for the mini-activities I inserted throughout the talk, where the students were asked how to replicate a certain design.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>

                  <p>At the end, I had everyone take part in a Figma Quilt; each student had to contribute one square frame. The only constraints I had were to make use of a prescribed color palette, and to use components (if possible). Here&#x27;s what we all came up with at the end!</p>

                  <h4>Feedback</h4>
                  <p>Things students liked about the workshop were:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Hands-on approach:</strong> they were able to get real-time practice from working in the same document as the instructor; this was supplemented by the fun activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easily digestible content:</strong> the unconventional format of the talk made it for them easier to digest a new platform like Figma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Highlighted application: </strong>the workshop insights became more memorable thanks to being reinforced by multiple examples.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>However, points for improvement were:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Chaotic presentation:</strong> having the students test out Figma while the talk was going on made the presentation confusing. This could be avoided in the future by creating separate pages for the speaker and the students.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slower pacing:</strong> despite being targeted to beginners, the workshop felt too fast for them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incorporation of web design principles:</strong> the examples &amp; activity in the workshop leaned towards graphic design. These could have been done from a product design perspective instead (e.g. replicating an app screen).</li>
                    <li><strong>Take-home activities: </strong>so that students could practice on their own time, even after the workshop.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>PROTOTYPING &amp; INTERACTIONS</h3>
                  <p>In this workshop, I taught how to prototype designs with Figma, from creating connections to adjusting animations. The learnings from the talk were supported by product design examples, along with real-time demonstrations.</p>

                  <p>At the end, I challenged the students to quickly prototype a delivery app. They were divided into 4 groups, aided by experienced facilitators. Despite me telling the students to prioritize function over visuals, they still took a lot of time in crafting the UI of their prototypes. If I had the chance to do this workshop again, I would&#x27;ve provided a wireframe kit so that they could focus more on prototyping.</p>

                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Speaker excellence:</strong> they liked the teacher (me) for being knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and engaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application through activity:</strong> what made the workshop a great learning experience was the quick prototyping activity, since they were able to try out what they learned for themselves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Group collaboration:</strong> since they were in groups, students were able to help each out so that they could deliver the best design they could</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>However, points for improvement were:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Inadequate explanation:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t able to explain the characteristics of the animations properly; as a result, students found it hard to distinguish them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of examples:</strong> connecting to the above reason, students wished for more application to real-world product design (e.g. reasoning behind design decisions, best practices).</li>
                    <li><strong>Dead air:</strong> during the activity, some groups were collaborating silently, which is quite saddening. This could be avoided in the future by training facilitators on how to lead and manage group activities.</li>

                  <h3>DESIGNING FOR DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                  <p>In this workshop, I introduced <strong>design systems. </strong>I discussed what they are, what their value is, what they consist of, and how they can be built on Figma. This was supplemented by examples, real-time demonstrations, and check-ins for students inserted throughout the talk.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>

                  <p>At the end, I prepared a group activity where the students had to create a design system based on a prompt, and apply this in designing a mobile screen. Initially, this was supposed to have facilitators; however, I requested for this too late, so I had to add more guides for the students (e.g. pegs, instructions, example design system pages).</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, during this part of the workshop, Figma went down. So I had to improvise by demonstrating on the spot: doing the activity on my own, taking on suggestions from the students.</p>

                  <li><strong>In-depth content: </strong>the workshop covered design systems thoroughly, especially when it came ot technical parts (e.g. making variants).</li>
                  <li><strong>Tons of interaction:</strong> they appreciated how much I engaged with them, whether it be through testing their knowledge or asking them for design suggestions. The small turnout in this workshop (around 10 people) actually helped make it feel more cozy.</li>

                  <li><strong>Lack of time:</strong> the time allotted for the workshop didn&#x27;t feel enough for the students. However, 2 hours is already long; instead of increasing time, what could be done instead is adjusting sections of different parts of the program flow (e.g. less time for activity, more time for talk).</li>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Turnout varied wildly; some workshops would have around 20 people attend, while others reached as high as 100+. What surprised me too was how most respondents ended up not being affiliated with User Experience Society or Ateneo; it showed me just how much people wanted to learn design. Based on feedback, the workshops were consistently rated high across different aspects (i.e. lecture, activity, speaker, logistics, overall experience).</p>
                <p>‍</p>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>When it comes to an online setting, I&#x27;ve learned that <strong>a simplified bite-sized approach is best for workshops with big audiences.</strong> This is because many attendees struggled to match the pace of the workshops due to complicated content, flow, and time constraints. To handle this for future workshops, here are some recommendations:</p>
                <ul role="list">
                  <li>Step-by-step guide with photo references on what should happen</li>
                  <li>Teach as if audiences don’t know why this is important</li>
                  <li>Access to Figma file for hands-on learning</li>
                  <li>Provide homework or exercises for those who want to learn more</li>
                  <li>Show-and-check strategy (show what to do, and then make everyone follow)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Another downside of the workshop format is that it&#x27;s one-time only. I want to ensure that students can continue learning even after the workshop. Aside from providing take-home modules, this can be tackled by uploading recordings as soon as possible. This way, not only workshop attendees can review; those who weren&#x27;t able to attend also get a chance to learn. I&#x27;m also planning to make an internal guide on online workshop design and facilitation so that future User Experience Society core can replicate this.</p>
                <p>Spearheading design workshops for User Experience Society made me realize how much I love teaching. I can&#x27;t wait to work more on the future of education.</p>
                <p>‍</p>

                  <h2>How can we encourage self-learning in a world tired of online education?</h2>
                  <p>When Interhackt announced that its theme was &quot;Making and understanding together&quot;, education was what first came to mind; exhausting Zoom classes, tedious learning modules, and unfinished online courses show that it&#x27;s in dire need of an overhaul.

                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/market-research.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Then, we conducted user research our networks, targeting those who consider themselves self-learners. Our research objectives were learning:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>why they try to <strong>develop skills</strong> outside traditional curricula</li>
                    <li>what <strong>tactics</strong> they use in working towards their goals (and how effective they are)</li>
                    <li>how they measure their <strong>progress</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/survey.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Once we were done with surveys and interviews, we did affinity mapping, discovering common motivations and factors surrounding learning.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h4>People are motivated by...</h4>
                  <ol start="1" role="list">
                    <li>Professional Growth 💼</li>
                    <li>Pure Passion/Interest 💖</li>
                    <li>Prerequisites for School 🏫</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h4>Learning is affected by...</h4>
                  <ol start="1" role="list">
                    <li><strong>Community:</strong> Where can I discuss what I&#x27;ve learned and get feedback? Am I being held accountable by teachers and fellow learners? 🤝</li>
                    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Do I follow a step-by-step outline, or make my own structure? How much flexibility do I have? Can I select only what interests me? Am I able to go outside of the curriculum? 📐</li>
                    <li><strong>Application: </strong>Do I have opportunities to apply my insights (e.g. hands-on learning)? 🖐️</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h4>Key Insights:</h4>
                  <ol start="1" role="list">
                    <li>MOOCs, which utilize passive teaching and impersonal avenues for interaction, make it difficult for learners due to a <strong>lack of feedback</strong> and <strong>opportunities to put knowledge into practice.</strong></li>
                    <li>The abundance of free online materials can lead to <strong>information overload</strong>, making learners experience <strong>analysis paralysis.</strong> &quot;How do you know which [resources] are worth your time/actually beneficial for you?&quot; one of our interviewees said.</li>
                    <li>There are two types of learners: <strong>those who are fine on their own</strong> and <strong>those who are highly motivated by a community. </strong>How can we cater to both types?</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h3>PERSONAS</h3>
                  <p>Making use of our third insight, we developed personas to empathize with our target audiences better. We assumed that solitary learners would seek <strong>guidance and self-awareness</strong>, while those who need a community would seek <strong>connection and accountability.</strong></p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h4><strong>Single-Player Sarah 👤</strong></h4>
                  <blockquote><em>&quot;I&#x27;m so used to learning on my own. College just feels like homeschooling again because everything&#x27;s online.&quot;</em></blockquote>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Needs to accomplish:</strong> create structure for learning, track progress on projects, apply their learnings</li>
                    <li><strong>Needs to feel:</strong> secure; on top of their learning goals</li>
                    <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> How else can we motivate them outside of community features?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h4><strong>Multiplayer Mike 👥</strong></h4>
                  <blockquote><em>&quot;Even if discussion platforms exist on MOOCs, they’re not utilized enough. There’s barely any social factor to them, no kwentuhan (chit-chat).&quot;</em></blockquote>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Needs to accomplish:</strong> signal their learning activities, make meaningful connections, learn from creators in similar fields</li>
                    <li><strong>Needs to feel:</strong> supported; held accountable in working towards his goals</li>
                    <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> What kind of interaction points can engage them?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Thus, our goal for this project was to provide these self-learners <strong>a space for mindful learning.</strong></p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>I led interaction design from wireframe to prototype.</h2>
                  <p>While conducting research, we came across Anne-Laure Le Cunff&#x27;s <a href="https://nesslabs.com/mindframing"><strong>mindframing</strong></a>: a neuroscience-backed framework for personal growth. We liked this because it was structured yet flexible enough for self-learners; she describes in a literature review: &quot;Individuals can assess their own progress through the reflective practice of creating and publishing content throughout their self-growth process.&quot; Thus, mindframing became the foundation of our entire app.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/mindframing.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                    <figcaption>An overview of the mindframing process (via Nikki)</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Nikki came up with the user flows, which I then fleshed out into screens. Here&#x27;s the thought process behind designing the app:</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/user-flow.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h3>ONBOARDING</h3>
                  <p>When a user first opens the app, they are given a rundown of what the app offers. Then, they are directed to create their first pact. This was inspired by the creation process of popular habit tracking apps.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/onboarding.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h3>PACTS AND TASKS</h3>
                  <p>Once a pact is created, a user can log related tasks with descriptions and statuses (e.g. &quot;In Progress). These tasks are also posted in public, where they can be replied to (perfect for feedback and discussion). I took inspiration from social media platforms centered around short posts like Twitter and Makerlog.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/Pact-Creation.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/Tasks.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h3>COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</h3>
                  <p>Aside from public posts, users can also connect with others through the Explore tab. They can search up other pacts, join clubs centered around similar interests and locations, and engage in challenges: time-bound pacts hosted by clubs. This tab was modelled after Strava&#x27;s interface.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/Explore.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h3>SKILL VISUALIZATIONS</h3>
                  <p>Finally, the user&#x27;s profile gives an overall picture of how they are as a learner. You can see their activity, pacts, club, and statistics: data on what they&#x27;ve been learning and how long they&#x27;ve been working on it. This last part was a tricky design challenge: <strong>how can we visualize learning?</strong></p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/Profile.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Most products we looked at (i.e. Headspace, Duolingo) utilized streaks to track continuous usage. Nikki took inspiration from Github to create an activity heatmap, which represented how many tasks a user posted each day in Scenius.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/Activity.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>However, we knew this wasn&#x27;t sufficient for communicating depth/breadth across different skills, so we started exploring other visualizations like skill trees and roadmaps.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                    <div><img src="images/learningvisualizations.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
                  </figure>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>I eventually settled on bubble graphs; these were inspired by the skill maps of interactive CVs. Compared to the complex graphs were looking at, this was the most flexible option; it could accommodate a diverse set of skills instead of being limited to just one This visualization is based on the days; the more you commit to a certain skill, the darker and bigger the bubble will get. A table below this graph gets more into the details.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>

                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>While Nikki came up with the app&#x27;s brand identity, I built an <strong>atomic design system</strong> so that we could prototype everything on time.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>

                  <h2>Reflection</h2>
                  <p>Interhackt was all about exploring the future of interface design. Working on this project made me realize that innovative ideas don&#x27;t come from scratch; they can come from <strong>remixing what&#x27;s existing. </strong>This perspective has exposed me to a new range of possibilities; thinking about how the proof-of-work model (e.g. Strava) can be applied to so many fields excites me.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>Scenius can be misused for <strong>toxic productivity</strong> (i.e. setting unrealistic expectations). How can we mitigate creative burnout and discourage unhealthy competition?</li>
                    <li>One Interhackt participant also suggested designing <strong>“trails for learning”</strong>. This was inspired by Strava, you can download routes of other users so that you can try traversing them. How would this look like for learning?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>Thank You!</h2>
                  <p><strong>Nikki,</strong> my partner, who co-designed this project with me. The stress of the designathon wouldn&#x27;t have been enjoyable without our all-nighters together. I also had fun teaching her research and design practices on the fly!</p>
                  <p>The entire <strong>Interhackt</strong> community! The entire designathon experience was amazing thanks to them (e.g. interesting talks, support during demo day).</p>

                  <p>Developh is a student-led nonprofit accelerating technology &amp; experiences for social good. One of our initiatives is running an online community for budding technologists &amp; creatives in Southeast Asia. Our members mainly reside in our Facebook group, where we share events &amp; programming (e.g. internships, talks, hangouts, mentorship).</p>
                  <p>At the time of this research, the group had tons of untapped potential. Most of our projects were sparked from our intuitive urges, but we weren&#x27;t sure if these catered to the needs of our target audience. Because of this, we wanted to conduct foundational research that would empower us to make data-driven decisions in the future.</p>
                  <p><strong>How can we make being part of Developh Community a more meaningful experience?</strong></p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>by improving how we engage and educate our members online</li>
                    <li>by strengthening the identity of the community</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>I led the Developh team in conducting user research.</h2>
                  <p>First, we created a survey. Questions were centered around themes of identity, experience, and structure, taken from the Community Canvas framework. This was then disseminated in the Facebook group. We then contacted respondents who opted in for a 1-hour interview. Finally, the Developh team worked together to analyze and cluster the data we gathered through affinity mapping.</p>

                  <p>Since we our first round of interviews, the Developh community has grown enormously (from around 400 to 1000+ members!). Thus, we&#x27;ll be conducting another round of interviews next year in order to get a better picture of our community. Stay tuned!</p>

                  <h2>Insurance in the Philippines is ripe for disruption.</h2>
                  <p>Despite insurance being a giant industry in the Philippines, life insurance penetration remains low. This is because of how much this sector is technologically underdeveloped. As a result, people delay getting insurance because they find the whole process difficult and frustrating.</p>
                  <p>How might we make the process easier for Filipinos? Enter InsurePlus: a special membership program where people can get life insurance from all the top providers in the country.</p>

                  <p>The <strong>365 Wonders 2019 Creative Planner</strong> is a creative planner that aimed to spark feminist consciousness through Filipino art. It is an initiative of <a href="https://womancreate.com"><strong>Woman, Create:</strong></a> an art studio that focuses on art-making, design, independent publication and events, and advocacy for intersectional feminism (or ‘everyday’ feminism) for Filipinos. Copies of this planner were sold nationwide, and a portion of its proceeds was donated to Young Focus, a non-profit organization that works to bring education to kids and families in Smokey Mountain, Tondo, Manila.</p>
                  <p>As one of the five Creatives Interns of Woman, Create for the batch of Summer 2018, I contributed to the “Diversity” cover (first cover, bottom-left part) and created two monthly cover artworks based on feminist themes.</p>

                  <h3>SHE STANDS</h3>
                  <p><strong>Month: January | Theme: “Feminism: Where We Stand”</strong></p>
                  <p>In a patriarchal narrative, gender roles are strictly defined — with man, being the breadwinners and women, only caretakers. Because we raise girls with this construct, girls struggle with the notions of leadership. This is a reminder that leadership is not gender-based, but an intrinsic, human-based characteristic.</p>
                  <p>Inspiration is derived from girls who strive to succeed in a world designed to be against them. Pastel colors play an element of feminity for girls who do not need to embody constructs of masculinity in order to exude power. A scout and a soldier was shown in the belief that both can embody girl power. The background illustrates an ideal world: one of solidarity.</p>
                  <h3>ARE YOU ASKING FOR THIS?</h3>
                  <p><strong>Month: October | Theme: “Power”</strong></p>
                  <p>To this day, women globally continue to live daily in a constant state of fear. Violence and harassment against women knows no logic, shape, or form. Studies by feminist scholars have often examined the effects on women living in fear, which may range from extra protection measures, establishing precautional routines, conformity to standardized rules. Overall, these effects reflect the powerless of women in the face of patriarchal violence.</p>
                  <p>This piece is an alternative of that powerlessness. Comically drawn that exudes inspiration from superhero graphic novels, this illustrates a girl who is no longer a reflection of these effects. Cornered in an alley, she wants to fight back. Unsheathing her sword, she is ready for the attack.</p>

                  <p>
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecanvasnight/">The Canvas</a> is a showcase at <a href="https://nudefloor.com">Nude Floor</a> (my favorite dance studio in Metro Manila) starring students + organized by students (or &quot;Nudists&quot;, our name for the budding community at the studio). What initially started out as a joke in the group chat (&quot;gawa tayo event&quot; 👀) eventually became an official event organized in 2-3 months, all for the sake of giving back to the community.
                  </p>
                  <p>I volunteered to oversee the design for the event. Creating every poster in Procreate, I went for a handdrawn feel for the following reasons: 1.) to fit the canvas theme, and 2.) to emulate the love and care all the students put into preparing for this event. Aside from graphic design, I also did social media management and video editing.</p>

                  <p>
                    <a href="https://icrcce.arist.co/">Talking Trauma: The Impact of Reporting on Humanitarian Crises</a> is an engaging 9-day SMS-based microlearning course created by The International Red Cross that is designed to allow for critical thinking on the subject of trauma and its impacts on communities made vulnerable by conflict or other disasters. Through this, it aims to empower communicators and humanitarians alike. I assisted in the art direction of the course&#x27;s visuals.

                  <p><strong>All-kill:</strong> (n.) when a song reaches #1 in all realtime charts.</p>
                  <p>Allkill Apparel was a mockup clothing brand that created minimalistic clothes inspired by Korean culture and aesthetic. Tired of the typical jersey shirts that defined K-pop fan merchandise, I created this brand as a design experiment. I designed the brand’s identity and collateral, along with its first collection. I also shot and edited the photos released.</p>
